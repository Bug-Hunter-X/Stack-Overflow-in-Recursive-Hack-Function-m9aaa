# Stack Overflow in Recursive Hack Function

This repository demonstrates a stack overflow error in a recursive Hack function. The function `foo` calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.  However, for large inputs, the recursive calls exceed the stack limit, resulting in a stack overflow error.

The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by using iteration instead of recursion, or by setting a recursion depth limit.
